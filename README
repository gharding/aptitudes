This git repo is essentially comprised of several files which all contain answers to "tech questions" which all help to show my current ability in relation to writing code, troubleshooting, and providing solutions to preventing different types of security breach.

I hope that these answers make for good reading, each piece can be run as a standalone web page with the necessary script provided to drive it and make it work.

Live versions of these pieces of code can be found at http://sandbox.glennharding.co.uk/aptitude
