	<h1>Fibonacci Sequence</h1>
	<p>The Fibonacci sequence can be described as being a numeric sequence where any given number in that sequence is the sum of the previous two. For example, the 4th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 3 which is the sum of the 2nd and the 3rd (1 and 2). The fibernacci sequence always begins with 0 and 1. This is primarily to ensure that the sequence will actually get started.</p>
	<p>To create a function which would be able to return the nth Fibonacci number, we would have to understand the concept of recursion, which involves a function making a call to itself until a condition is met. This means then, that we will have to create a recursive function which will take the input from the user and will then make recursive calls to the same piece of code until we have to correct number.</p>
